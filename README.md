# Mandelbrot-Python
Experimenting with Python and visualizing the Mandelbrot Set. <br />
MandelbrotRend.py is quite rigid, also being grayscale. <br />
MandelbrotRend_2.py is more flexible, allowing a user to specify <br />
&nbsp&nbsp which part of the set they wish to view but continues to <br />
&nbsp&nbsp be grayscale.
